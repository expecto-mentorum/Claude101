# Custom Skills — Your Team's Playbook — Practical

> **Duration**: ~25 minutes
> **What you'll build**: Three custom skills (K8s reviewer, Dockerfile auditor, file explainer) plus a test drive of the built-in `/simplify` on your dark theme code.

---

## Step 1: Create the K8s Review Skill (~5 min)

This is our first custom skill — a read-only reviewer that checks Kubernetes manifests against best practices. It can look at your code but cannot modify anything.

Create the skill directory and file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ai-coderrank/.claude/skills/review-k8s
```

Create `.claude/skills/review-k8s/SKILL.md` with the following content:

```markdown
---
name: review-k8s
description: Reviews Kubernetes manifests for best practices, security, and operational readiness
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
---

You are a senior SRE reviewing Kubernetes manifests before they go to production. Be thorough but practical — flag real issues, not theoretical nitpicks.

## Instructions

1. Use Glob to find all YAML files in the `k8s/` directory
2. Read each manifest file
3. Check every resource against the following criteria

## Checklist

### Resource Management
- [ ] CPU and memory requests are set
- [ ] CPU and memory limits are set
- [ ] Requests are lower than or equal to limits
- [ ] Resource values are reasonable (not 10 CPU cores for a web server)

### Security
- [ ] `runAsNonRoot: true` is set in the security context
- [ ] `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` where applicable
- [ ] Capabilities are dropped (`drop: ["ALL"]`)
- [ ] No privileged containers
- [ ] No host networking or host PID

### Health & Reliability
- [ ] Liveness probe is configured
- [ ] Readiness probe is configured
- [ ] Startup probe for slow-starting containers
- [ ] Pod disruption budget exists for critical services
- [ ] Replica count is greater than 1 for production services

### Image Hygiene
- [ ] No `latest` tag — images are pinned to a specific version
- [ ] Image pull policy is appropriate (IfNotPresent for tagged, Always for mutable)
- [ ] Images come from an expected registry

### Labels & Metadata
- [ ] Standard Kubernetes labels are present (app.kubernetes.io/name, etc.)
- [ ] Labels are consistent across related resources (Deployment, Service, etc.)
- [ ] Namespace is explicitly set (not relying on `default`)

### Networking
- [ ] Services use appropriate type (ClusterIP for internal, LoadBalancer/Ingress for external)
- [ ] Port names follow convention (http, https, grpc, metrics)
- [ ] Network policies exist if the cluster uses them

## Output Format

For each file reviewed, produce:

### `<filename>`
**Overall**: PASS / WARN / FAIL

| Issue | Severity | Details | Suggested Fix |
|-------|----------|---------|---------------|
| ... | Critical/Warning/Info | What's wrong | How to fix it |

End with a **Summary** section: total files reviewed, critical issues, warnings, and a recommended priority order for fixes.
```

> **Notice the `allowed-tools` section.** This skill can only Read, Glob, and Grep. It cannot edit files, run commands, or make any changes. This is a reviewer, not a fixer — it tells you what's wrong and lets you decide what to do about it.

---

## Step 2: Create the Docker Audit Skill (~5 min)

Same pattern — a read-only skill that audits Dockerfiles for common issues.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ai-coderrank/.claude/skills/check-docker
```

Create `.claude/skills/check-docker/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: check-docker
description: Audits Dockerfiles for security, performance, and build optimization
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
---

You are a Docker build optimization expert reviewing a Dockerfile before it ships.

## Instructions

1. Read the `Dockerfile` in the project root
2. Check for a `.dockerignore` file — read it if it exists
3. Evaluate the Dockerfile against every criterion below
4. Check that `.dockerignore` excludes common unnecessary files

## Dockerfile Checklist

### Build Stages
- [ ] Uses multi-stage builds (separate build and runtime stages)
- [ ] Build dependencies don't leak into the final image
- [ ] Final stage uses a minimal base image (alpine, distroless, or slim)
- [ ] Base image is pinned to a specific version (not just `node:20`, but `node:20.11-alpine`)

### Layer Optimization
- [ ] Package manager install + cleanup happen in the same RUN instruction
- [ ] `COPY package*.json` (or equivalent) happens BEFORE `COPY . .` for layer caching
- [ ] Dependencies are installed before application code is copied
- [ ] Unnecessary files are not copied into the image

### Security
- [ ] Final image runs as non-root user (`USER node` or custom user)
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or credentials in the Dockerfile or build args
- [ ] `apt-get update && apt-get install` are combined and cleaned up
- [ ] No `sudo` or `chmod 777` in the Dockerfile

### Runtime
- [ ] `EXPOSE` matches the actual port the application listens on
- [ ] `HEALTHCHECK` instruction is present (or documented why it's omitted)
- [ ] Entrypoint uses exec form (`["node", "server.js"]`) not shell form
- [ ] Signal handling is correct (PID 1 problem addressed)

### .dockerignore
- [ ] `.dockerignore` exists
- [ ] Excludes: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `*.md`, `.env*`, `.vscode/`, `coverage/`
- [ ] Excludes K8s and ArgoCD config (not needed in the image)

## Output Format

### Dockerfile Audit Report

**Image**: `<base image detected>`
**Stages**: `<number of stages>`
**Final image size estimate**: `<estimate based on base image + dependencies>`

| Category | Status | Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Build Stages | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... | ... |
| Layer Caching | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... | ... |
| Security | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... | ... |
| Runtime | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... | ... |
| .dockerignore | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... | ... |

## Step 3: Test `/review-k8s` on the Project (~3 min)

Time to see your first custom skill in action. Start Claude Code in the ai-coderrank project:

```bash
cd ~/ai-coderrank
claude
```

Now run your skill:

```
/review-k8s
```

Claude will:
1. Discover all YAML files in `k8s/`
2. Read each one
3. Evaluate them against your checklist
4. Produce a structured report with findings and severity ratings

Pay attention to what it finds. Common issues in the ai-coderrank manifests:
- Missing resource limits
- No security context
- Missing health check probes
- `latest` image tags

> **Key insight**: You just ran a comprehensive K8s review with a single command. A junior engineer who has never written a Kubernetes manifest can run this and get senior-level feedback. That's the power of skills.

---

## Step 4: Test `/check-docker` on the Dockerfile (~3 min)

Still in your Claude Code session:

```
/check-docker
```

Watch Claude audit the Dockerfile systematically. It should produce a report covering:
- Whether multi-stage builds are used
- Layer caching effectiveness
- Security posture (non-root user, no secrets)
- The state of `.dockerignore`

Compare the output to what you'd check manually. Anything it caught that you might have missed?

---

## Step 5: Create a Parameterized Skill with `$ARGUMENTS` (~5 min)

Now let's build a flexible skill that takes input — an explainer that works on any file you point it at.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ai-coderrank/.claude/skills/explain
```

Create `.claude/skills/explain/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: explain
description: Explains any file in plain, jargon-free English
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
---

Read the file at `$ARGUMENTS`.

If the path doesn't exist, use Glob to search for likely matches and ask the user to confirm.

## Your Task

Explain this file as if you're talking to a smart developer who just joined the team and has never seen this codebase before.

## Structure Your Explanation As:

### What This File Does
One sentence. No jargon. What problem does it solve?

### How It Works — Step by Step
Walk through the file's logic from top to bottom. For each significant section:
- What it does
- Why it does it that way (if non-obvious)
- What would break if you removed it

### Key Patterns to Know
- Design patterns used (and why)
- Non-obvious conventions
- Anything a new developer might find surprising

### Connections
- What files import or depend on this file?
- What does this file import or depend on?
- If you changed this file, what else might need updating?

### Watch Out For
- Common mistakes when editing this file
- Edge cases it handles (or doesn't)
- Performance considerations

Keep the language conversational. Use analogies where they help. If something is genuinely complex, say so — but explain it anyway.
```

Now test it in your Claude Code session:

```
/explain src/app/page.tsx
/explain k8s/deployment.yaml
/explain Dockerfile
```

Each invocation replaces `$ARGUMENTS` with the path you provided. Same skill, different targets. Notice how the explanations adapt to the file type — a React component gets explained differently than a K8s manifest.

---

## Step 6: Run `/simplify` on the Dark Theme Changes (~3 min)

Remember the dark theme you implemented in Block 4? Let's see if `/simplify` can clean it up.

In your Claude Code session:

```
/simplify
```

`/simplify` is a built-in skill that:
1. Looks at your recent code changes
2. Identifies opportunities for reuse (are you reimplementing something that already exists in the codebase?)
3. Spots code quality improvements
4. Finds performance optimizations
5. Applies the fixes automatically

Watch what it finds in your dark theme implementation. Common things `/simplify` catches:
- Duplicate color values that should be CSS variables or Tailwind theme extensions
- Conditional class logic that could use `clsx` or `cn()` more cleanly
- Components that could share a common base style
- Theme toggle logic that could be simplified with a custom hook

Review each change it proposes. Accept the ones you agree with.

> **When to use `/simplify`**: After finishing any feature implementation. Write code to make it work, then `/simplify` to make it clean. It's like having a code reviewer who only cares about craft — no ego, no style wars, just "here's how this code could be better."

---

## Step 7: Understand `allowed-tools` Restrictions (~1 min)

Let's make the difference crystal clear.

**Restricted skill** (our review-k8s):
```yaml
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
```
- Can read files, search patterns, list files
- CANNOT edit files, write files, or run bash commands
- Perfect for: reviews, audits, explanations, reports

**Unrestricted skill** (no `allowed-tools` in frontmatter):
```yaml
---
name: fix-k8s-issues
description: Fixes common K8s manifest issues automatically
---
```
- Can use ALL tools — read, write, edit, run commands
- Can make changes directly to your files
- Perfect for: automated fixes, code generation, refactoring

**The decision is simple**: If a skill only needs to _observe and report_, restrict it. If it needs to _make changes_, leave it unrestricted. When in doubt, start restricted — you can always loosen it later.

Try running `/review-k8s` and then asking Claude to "fix issue #1 from the report" in the same session. The skill will have finished, and Claude (now back in regular mode, not skill mode) can make the fix with full tool access.

---

## Checkpoint

Your `.claude/skills/` directory should now look like this:

```
.claude/
  skills/
    review-k8s/
      SKILL.md          ← K8s best practices reviewer (restricted)
    check-docker/
      SKILL.md          ← Dockerfile auditor (restricted)
    explain/
      SKILL.md          ← File explainer with $ARGUMENTS (restricted)
```

You've also used the built-in `/simplify` skill on real code. These four commands now live in your project — any teammate who pulls the repo gets them for free.

---

## Bonus Challenges

**Challenge 1: Create a `/generate-test` skill**
Build an unrestricted skill that takes a file path via `$ARGUMENTS`, reads the file, and generates a test file following the testing conventions from your Block 5 `.claude/rules/testing.md`. It should create the test file in the right location and use the right framework.

**Challenge 2: Create a personal skill**
Create a skill in `~/.claude/skills/` (not in the project) that does something you personally find useful. Ideas:
- `/tldr` — summarizes any file in 3 bullet points
- `/review-pr` — reviews the current branch's diff against main
- `/standup` — generates a standup update from your recent git commits

**Challenge 3: Chain skills**
Run `/review-k8s`, then use the findings to manually ask Claude to fix the critical issues. Compare the before and after by running `/review-k8s` again. The second report should show improvements.

> **Next up**: In Block 7, we take Claude Code beyond the codebase and into real infrastructure — Docker builds, Kubernetes clusters, and SSH into live servers. Claude doesn't just write code; it operates systems.

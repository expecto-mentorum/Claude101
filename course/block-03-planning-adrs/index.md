title: "Planning with ADRs & Diagrams"
block_number: 3
description: "Use Plan mode to think before acting, create Architecture Decision Records, and generate Mermaid infrastructure diagrams — all before writing a single line of code."
time: "~35 min (10 min presentation + 25 min practical)"
features:
  - Plan Mode (/plan, Shift+Tab)
  - Ultraplan (/ultraplan)
  - Edit/Write Tools
  - Structured Output
  - Mermaid Diagrams
objectives:
  - Understand why planning matters even when working with AI
  - Use Plan mode to outline a multi-file theme change before touching code
  - Know when to keep planning local and when to send a bigger task to ultraplan on Claude Code on the web
  - Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) that captures the *why* behind a decision
  - Generate Mermaid diagrams for infrastructure topology, traffic flow, and deployment pipeline
  - Review and iterate on a plan before committing to implementation

## Measure Twice, Cut Once

Here's a pattern that kills projects: someone opens a file, starts hacking, and three hours later they've changed 47 files and can't remember why they started. AI makes this worse — it's so fast at making changes that you can dig yourself into a hole at superhuman speed.

Plan mode is the antidote. It's Claude Code's way of saying: "Let me think about this first, show you what I'd do, and get your approval before I touch anything."

This block is about discipline. Not the boring kind — the kind that makes you faster. We're going to plan the dark theme change we'll implement in Block 4, and we'll leave behind documentation that future-you will actually thank present-you for writing.

## What We'll Cover

1. **Plan mode and ultraplan** — when to plan locally, and when to send a bigger plan to Claude Code on the web
2. **Architecture Decision Records** — lightweight docs that capture decisions and their reasoning
3. **Mermaid diagrams** — text-based diagrams that live in your repo and render on GitHub
4. **The dark theme plan** — mapping out every file we'll touch, every variable we'll change, before writing a single line of code

## What You'll Create

By the end of this block, your repo will have four new files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/adr/001-dark-theme.md` | Decision record for the theme change |
| `docs/diagrams/infrastructure.md` | Mermaid diagram of the DO + k3s topology |
| `docs/diagrams/traffic-flow.md` | Mermaid diagram of request routing |
| `docs/diagrams/deployment-pipeline.md` | Mermaid diagram of the CI/CD pipeline |

These aren't homework assignments. They're the kind of artifacts that senior engineers produce before making infrastructure-level changes — and Claude can generate them in minutes.

## Why This Matters for DevOps

If you've ever inherited a project and asked "why is this configured this way?" — only to find zero documentation — you know the pain. ADRs solve that. They're not design docs (those are long and nobody reads them). ADRs are short, opinionated, and answer one question: **why did we make this choice?**

And Mermaid diagrams? They're version-controlled, diff-friendly, and GitHub renders them natively. No more Lucidchart links that expire when someone leaves the company.

One more planning tool is worth keeping in mind even before we demo it deeply in Block 13: **`/ultraplan`**. Local `/plan` is perfect when the terminal is enough. Ultraplan is for bigger changes where you want Claude to draft the plan remotely on Claude Code on the web, let you comment inline in the browser, and then either execute in the web session or send the approved plan back to your terminal.

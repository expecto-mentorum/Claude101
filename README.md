# Claude Code 101

A hands-on course teaching DevOps, SRE, QA, and developers to use Claude Code in daily workflows.

**Live site**: [exitstatus0.github.io/Claude101](https://exitstatus0.github.io/Claude101)

## What This Is

14 progressive blocks that take you from your first `claude` command to deploying a real application on Kubernetes via GitOps. Each block is a single page with two sections: **Presentation** (talking points for voice-over) and **Hands-On** (step-by-step screen-sharing guide).

The course uses [ai-coderrank](https://github.com/exitStatus0/ai-coderrank) as the real-world project. By the end, you'll have deployed a modified version (dark theme) to a k3s cluster on DigitalOcean, accessible via public internet.

```bash
# macOS: install Ruby via Homebrew if system Ruby is too old
brew install ruby
# Or use a version manager:
# rbenv install 3.3.0 && rbenv local 3.3.0
# asdf install ruby 3.3.0

# Install Jekyll dependencies
bundle install

# Serve locally
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:4000/Claude101/
```
